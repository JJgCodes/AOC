Sample data; 

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves
 - The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories
